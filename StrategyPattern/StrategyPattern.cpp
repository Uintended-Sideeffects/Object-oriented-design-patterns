/*Algorithm (IBehavior) has the ability to be independent from the client meaning:
-> There could be different types of behaviors (Remember : The duck example)
-> This design pattern motivates to not use inheritance to make specialized classes, rather have interface class for the beahaviors, 
   and have special behaviors*/

/*
 -> The Strategy pattern lets you indirectly alter the objectâ€™s behavior at runtime by associating it with different sub-objects which
    can perform specific sub-tasks in different ways.
 -> Use the Strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.
 -> Use the pattern to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not be as important
    in the context of that logic.
 -> Use the pattern when your class has a massive conditional operator that switches between different variants of the same algorithm
